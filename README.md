# HR_Analysis_Power-Bi_Dashboard
In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data to identify key factors influencing employee turnover. Using Power BI, I created interactive visualizations to uncover patterns and insights related to why 237 employees left the company.
# Objective:
1. Identify the primary reasons behind employee attrition.
2. Analyze trends based on key factors such as department, salary, job satisfaction and promotion.
# Key Findings:
Department Impact: The highest attrition was seen in the Sales and R&D departments.
Salary Influence: Employees with lower salaries had a higher attrition rate.
Experience Factor: Most employees leaving had 1-5 years of experience of age group (26-35), suggesting early-career professionals were more likely to resign.
# Power BI Features Used:
Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
DAX Measures for insights (Attrition Rate %, Avg. Salary by Department)
Interactive Dashboards (Filters for deep analysis)
Visualizations (Bar Charts, pie charts, Attrition Trends, cards)
# Conclusion:
The analysis revealed that low salary, job satisfaction and early-career exits were major contributors to employee attrition. The insights can help HR teams improve retention strategies by addressing these factors.
